                        <p>"Cam streamlined processes well. From the first meeting, she asked great questions to understand the goal of our website creation. She accomplished the marketing goals we were trying to achieve. The website and logo they designed was exactly what we were hoping for! I didn't really know what I wanted going into the project, but Cam and her team definitely delivered! I've recommended Cam to a few others already. Cam takes the time to understand your individual needs."</p>
